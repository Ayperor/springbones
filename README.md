# Spring Bones
Blender addon to add spring/bouncy dynamic effect to bones

It's currently in a very early state, alpha-proof of concept.
The effect applies on the bone position only, no rotation.
User support is not granted for it considering this state.

## Installation

- Install the .py file in Blender 2.8
- In Pose Mode, go to the "Spring Bones" panel in the Bone tools section on the right.
- Click "Enable Bone" on a bone parented to another bone and click "Start" to enable the effect.
- When moving the parent bone, the child will move dynamically with bouncy effect.
