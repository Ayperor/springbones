# Spring Bones
Blender addon to add spring/bouncy dynamic effect to bones.

It's currently in a very early state, alpha-proof of concept.
The effect applies to the bone position only, no rotation.
User support is not granted for it considering this early state, it may be buggy but still fun to play with :)

## Installation

- Install the .py file in Blender 2.8
- In Pose Mode, go to the "Spring Bones" panel in the Bone tools section on the right.
- Click "Enable Bone" on a bone parented to another bone and click "Start" to enable the effect.
- You can adjust the "Bouncy" and "Speed" parameters
- When moving the parent bone, the child will move dynamically with bouncy motion
